23.06.11	Phalanges, bifid	HP:0009999	Partial duplication of the phalanx of hand	?	There are several terms for specific bifid phalanges. Bifid implies that the duplication is only partial and the HPO term Partial duplication of the phalanges of the hand (HP:0009999) does not include complete duplications of phalanges ﾖ is this really what ios meant by this LDDB term? However, I wonder if this LDDB term implies that all phalanges are bifid (must be rare) or merely that at least one is?

25.01.09	Reduction deformity of legs, some digits	HP:0006493	Aplasia/Hypoplasia involving bones of the lower limbs	?	This is a really much to general term: does this mean femur or tibia and fibula or some toes missing? The HPO term Aplasia/Hypoplasia involving bones of the lower limbs (HP:0006493) subsumes all those but unfortunately also includes terms such as Peromelia which would belong to the LDDB-term Reduction deformity of legs, no digits
25.01.11	Proportionate shortening of lower limb	HP:0009816	Hypoplasia involving bones of the lower limbs	?	There are a number of HPO terms that cover this including other more detailed terms.

32.31.06	Myelination/absent or delayed	HP:0011400	Abnormal CNS myelination	OK	! this HPO-term is a child of the gereal term Neurological abnormality and as such it does not refer exclusively to for example cerebral myelinisation. Is this correct regarding the LDDB-term? Please check.
